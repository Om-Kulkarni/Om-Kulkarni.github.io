Hello, I'm Om. I'm currently a Master's student in Robotics at the University of Bristol, conducting my dissertation research at the renowned Bristol Robotics Laboratory on controlling robots with eye-tracking in VR.

At the heart of my academic and professional pursuits is a fascination with Visual Language Action models (VLAs). I believe the next frontier in robotics is building machines that don't just perform tasks, but truly understand our world through vision and language. I'm dedicated to pushing these models beyond the lab, exploring how they can be adapted for not just robotic arms, but for complex systems operating in the air and sea.

My path to robotics wasn't a straight line, but it started with a single moment: watching the Atlas robot do a backflip. That awe inspired me to get my hands dirty in my university's robotics club. This passion soon turned into a profession, leading to a two-year position as a robotics developer at Miko.AI. Seeking to build upon that practical foundation, I came to Bristol to immerse myself in the deeper theoretical challenges of the field.

The future I'm working towards is heavily inspired by the worlds I've explored in video games like Fallout 4 and Horizon Zero Dawnâ€”worlds where robotics are seamlessly and intelligently integrated into life. For me, science fiction is a blueprint for what's possible, and it fuels my research every day.

Outside of robotics, my curiosity extends to many places. I enjoy the challenge and solitude of trekking and solo trips. I'm an avid consumer of stories, whether through narrative-driven games, fantasy novels, or epic sci-fi shows like The Expanse (I can't wait to read the books!). I also enjoy a good game of chess or a session of D&D with friends.

I'd love to connect. Feel free to browse my [Projects](/projects/) and [Work Experience](/work-experience/) or email me directly at: [kulkarniom066@gmail.com](mailto:kulkarniom066@gmail.com)
