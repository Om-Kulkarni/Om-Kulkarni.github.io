## Project Overview
This research project investigated the relationship between participants' internal emotional states and their perception of emotional expressions displayed by the NAO humanoid robot. The study aimed to understand how human emotional states influence the interpretation of robotic emotional expressions, contributing to the field of affective human-robot interaction.

### Research Objectives
* Investigate the correlation between participants' mood states and their perception of NAO's emotions
* Analyze the effectiveness of NAO's emotional expression capabilities
* Study the impact of human emotional state on human-robot interaction

### Methodology

#### Study Design
* **Participant Assessment**:
  - Pre-interaction mood evaluation
  - Demographic data collection
  - Previous experience with robots
  - Emotional state measurement

* **Robot Interaction**:
  - Programmed NAO with various emotional expressions
  - Controlled interaction scenarios
  - Recorded participant responses
  - Real-time behavior analysis

#### Technical Implementation
* **NAO Robot Programming**:
  - Emotional expression choreography
  - Speech pattern modulation
  - Gesture synchronization
  - Interactive behavior implementation

* **Data Collection**:
  - Participant response recording
  - Behavioral observation
  - Survey administration
  - Video analysis of interactions

### Key Findings
* Significant correlation between participant mood and emotion perception
* Variations in interpretation of NAO's emotional expressions
* Impact of previous robot experience on interaction quality
* Role of anthropomorphic features in emotional connection

### Technical Details
* **Robot Control**:
  - Python programming for NAO
  - Choregraphe software utilization
  - Behavior planning and execution
  - Multi-modal expression control

* **Interaction Design**:
  - Structured interaction scenarios
  - Controlled environmental variables
  - Timing and response monitoring
  - Adaptive interaction patterns

### Research Impact
* Advanced understanding of human-robot emotional interaction
* Contributed to affective computing research
* Enhanced robot emotion expression design
* Improved human-robot interaction methodologies

### Technologies Used
